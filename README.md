## Weather Forecast Application

**Description:** The Weather Forecast Application is a simple command-line-based program that allows users to retrieve the current weather information for a specific city. The application fetches weather data from a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) and displays it to the user in a user-friendly format.

**How the Application Works:**

1. **User Input:** The user launches the Weather Forecast Application from the command line and is prompted to enter the name of the city they want to check the weather for.

2. **Make API Request:** The application takes the user's input (city name) and makes a request to the weather API to fetch the current weather data for that city.

3. **Retrieve and Parse Data:** The application receives the response from the weather API, which is usually in JSON format. It then extracts relevant weather information from the JSON data.

4. **Display Weather Information:** The application presents the retrieved weather information to the user in a user-friendly format. It may include details such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy), wind speed, and any other relevant data provided by the API.

**Potential Improvements:**

- **Weather Forecast:** Extend the application to provide weather forecasts for the upcoming days, not just the current weather.
- **Unit Conversion:** Allow the user to choose their preferred unit system (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit for temperature, mph or km/h for wind speed).
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where the city name is misspelled, or the API response is not successful.
- **User Input Validation:** Validate user input to ensure the city name is valid and avoid unnecessary API requests with incorrect input.

**Learning Goals:**

- **API Integration:** Practice making API requests and handling responses from web APIs.
- **JSON Data Handling:** Learn how to parse and extract data from JSON format.
- **User Input/Output:** Improve handling user input and displaying information to users in a user-friendly manner.

**Note:** To implement this project, you will need to sign up for a free API key from a weather service provider, like OpenWeatherMap, which will grant you access to their API for retrieving weather data. Be mindful of API usage limits, as free-tier plans may have restrictions on the number of requests per day.

The Weather Forecast Application is an excellent project for beginners to gain experience with API integration and JSON data handling while providing a useful and practical tool for checking the weather in real-time.
